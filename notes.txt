Goal: Get an arbitrary object, and render its input field

1. get the object
2. determine its class
3. create a cell object for the td and that class
4. somehow tell the object that the value is the one we have

Option 1: Try to make it work as is.  make the field_info call return the hash for index 0
Option 2: Short circuit the two level thing, and just supply the value

Going to:

1. change everywhere to respect a root tree
2. pass the entire field tree up in one dot seperated string
3. make field info handle this
